# Outlook-Tools
V-Card Util Module.  This module will update the V-Card to V3 so that the vcard may be imported to Apple iCloud Contacts.  You must import the module into Outlook VBA and adjust security to allow the main macro: ConvertVCard().  I suggest you add the macro to the Quickaccess toolbar.  The steps are then easy, export a v-Card to your desktop on Windows, execute the macro, then import the v-card to iCloud Contacts.  If you export a number of v-cards to a folder on your desktop, it will convert the batch of contacts at once. (it will ask you to specify the folder).  You must reference the "Microsoft Scripting Runtime" in VBA under Tools>References... 
Pre-Requistites:  MS Office (uses some objects from Excel).
